 Brackeys "How To Make A Video Game" Tutorial W/ Mods
-Made game as guided by Brackeys' tutorial "How To Make A Video Game" https://youtu.be/j48LtUkZRjU

-Created an Intro scene with instructions on how to play and a button to a modified Menu scene. 

-Created a AudioSource game object which plays some original music continuously through the scenes by way of a Singleton Pattern. 

-Created an volume slider connected to a text area which displays the slider information via a script. 

-Modified the menu so that players can enter their name for display while in the game. The player name is stored in a text file for easy use between scenes.  

-Modified the menu with a "Choose Level" button, taking players to a scene where they can choose which levels they want to play.

-Once players are playing a level, they can select how fast the progress by way of a scroll bar on the bottom right. The speed is intentionally set to 0 so that players can start when they want. This also makes selecting an optimal speed easier, rather than trying to change it while avoiding obstacles.
